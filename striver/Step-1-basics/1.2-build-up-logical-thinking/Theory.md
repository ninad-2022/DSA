Four rule of the pattern:
1. for the outer loop, count the num of lines/row
2. for the inner loop, focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows
3. print them inside inner loop
4. observe symmetry in case of some patterns (Otional step as applicable for some patterns only)


LEARNINGS:
process.stdout.write(" "); O(n) for each print
console.log(""); O(n) for a single print
